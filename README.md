## 🚀 Why SaralDB?

Modern applications require multiple systems:

- MongoDB for documents  
- Redis for caching  
- Kafka for streaming  
- S3 for file storage  
- BullMQ for jobs  
- Socket servers for realtime  

This creates complexity, higher cost, and operational overhead.

**SaralDB solves this.**

SaralDB is a unified data platform built from scratch in **Rust**, combining all core backend infrastructure into a single high-performance engine.

One system. One architecture. Full backend power.

## 🧠 What is SaralDB?

SaralDB is a next-generation database designed for:

- AI workloads  
- CRM systems  
- EdTech platforms  
- SaaS products  
- ERP systems  
- Analytics dashboards  
- High-scale startups  

It merges:

- 📦 Document Database (Mongo-inspired)
- ⚡ Event Streaming (Kafka-style)
- 🧠 In-memory Cache (Redis-style)
- 📁 File Storage Engine
- 🔄 Background Job Processing
- 🔌 Real-time WebSocket Engine

All built natively inside one core.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

SaralDB follows a unified layered design:

**Application Layer**  
⬇  
**SaralDB Unified Core**  
⬇  
**High-Performance Storage Engine**

Inside the Unified Core:

- Document Engine  
- Cache Engine  
- Stream Engine  
- File Engine  
- Job Engine  
- Socket Engine  

Instead of gluing distributed tools together, SaralDB builds them into one cohesive architecture.

## ✨ Core Features

- Schema-less JSON-like document storage  
- High write throughput (append-only engine)  
- Crash-safe recovery (disk replay mechanism)  
- In-memory MemTable for ultra-fast reads  
- Redis-style caching  
- Kafka-style real-time streaming  
- Native file storage support  
- Background job execution engine  
- Real-time socket communication  
- Designed for millions of records  
- Modular Rust architecture  
- Future-ready indexing (B+ Tree / LSM)

---

## ⚡ Performance Philosophy

SaralDB follows three principles:

1. Performance First  
2. Simplicity Over Infrastructure Complexity  
3. Built for Indian-scale products  

Built in Rust to ensure:

- Memory safety  
- High concurrency  
- Low latency  
- Efficient CPU usage  
- Zero-cost abstractions  

---

## 🇮🇳 Vision

> Build India’s foundational data infrastructure.

SaralDB aims to become:

The first Indian-built large-scale unified database platform capable of powering next-generation startups and enterprises.

Instead of stitching together 5–6 technologies, developers can rely on a single integrated engine.

Simple to use.  
Fast by design.  
Built for scale.
